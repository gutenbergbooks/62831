<p>The glaciers of Glacier National Park are only a few of many
thousands which occur in mountain ranges scattered throughout the
world. Glaciers occur in all latitudes and on every continent except
Australia. They are present along the Equator on high volcanic peaks of
Africa and in the rugged Andes of South America. Even in New Guinea,
which many think of as a steaming, tropical jungle island, a few small
glaciers occur on the highest mountains.</p>
<p>Almost everyone who has made a trip to a high mountain range has
heard the term, &ldquo;snowline,&rdquo; and many persons have used the word without
knowing its real meaning. The snowline is the level above which more
snow falls in winter than can be melted or evaporated during the summer.
On mountains which rise above the snowline glaciers usually occur.
The snowline is an elusive feature and can be seen only in late summer.
For example, during the latter part of June snow extends from the summits
of most Glacier National Park mountains down their slopes to
timberline, and some snowbanks extend even lower. At that time the
snowline appears to be down near timberline. But as the summer progresses
and higher temperatures melt the lower-lying snowbanks this apparent
snowline retreats higher and higher up the slopes, until late August
or early September, when it reaches a point above which it will not
retreat. This lower limit of snow is the permanent or regional snowline.
It is usually referred to simply as the snowline. In Glacier National Park
the regional snowline actually lies above the summits of most peaks, at
a height of more than 10,000 feet. The only parts of the United States
south of Canada which project above the snowline are the highest summits
in the Cascade Range in California, Oregon, and Washington, and
in the Olympic Mountains in the latter state. There are many mountains
in Alaska that lie above the snowline. This is especially true in the
coastal ranges where the snowline is around 4,500 feet above sea level.</p>
<p>The Olympic area is unique, for here the regional snowline descends
to about 6,000 feet lower than anywhere within the boundaries of the
Continental United States south of Alaska. Extraordinarily heavy annual
snowfall and the high percentage of cloudy weather, which retards the
melting of snow, combine to depress the snowline to such a low level.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Glaciers of Glacier National Park</span></h2>
<p>Within the boundaries of Glacier National Park there are 50 to 60
glaciers, of which only two have surface areas of nearly one-half square
mile, and not more than seven others exceed one-fourth square mile
in area.</p>
<p>All these bodies of ice lie at the heads of valleys with high steep
headwalls on the east and north sides of high ridges at elevations between
6,000 and 9,000 feet, in all cases well below the snowline. Consequently,
these glaciers owe their origin and existence almost entirely to
wind-drifted snow.</p>
<p>Ice within these glaciers moves slowly. The average rate in the
smallest ones may be as low as 6 to 8 feet a year, and in the largest
probably 25 to 30 feet a year. There is no period of the year when a
glacier is motionless, although movement is somewhat slower in winter
than in summer. Despite the slowness of its motion the ice, over a period
of years, transports large quantities of rock material ultimately to the
glacier&rsquo;s end where it is piled up in the form of a moraine.</p>

<p>The largest glacier in the Park is Grinnell. In 1960 it had a surface
area of 315 acres.</p>
<p>Sperry is the second largest glacier in the Park. Its surface in
1960 was 287 acres. Both Grinnell and Sperry have probable maximum
thicknesses of 400 to 500 feet.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>JACKSON GLACIER IS VISIBLE FROM GOING-TO-THE-SUN ROAD</b> (BEATTY PHOTO)</p>
</div>
<p>Other important Park glaciers, although much smaller than the
first two mentioned, are Harrison, Chaney, Sexton, Jackson, Blackfoot,
Siyeh, and Ahern. Several others approach some of these in size, but
because of isolated locations they are seldom seen. As a matter of fact,
there are persons who visit Glacier National Park without seeing a
single glacier, while others, although they actually see glaciers, leave
the park without realizing they have seen them. This is because the
highways afford only distant views of the glaciers, which from a distance
appear much like mere accumulations of snow. A notable example is
Grinnell as seen from the highway along the shore of Sherburne Lake
and from the vicinity of the Many Glacier Entrance Station. The glacier,
despite its length of almost a mile, appears merely as a conspicuous
white patch high up on the Garden Wall at the head of the valley.</p>
<p>Several of the glaciers, however, are accessible by trail and are annually
visited by many hundreds of people, either on foot or by horse.
Most accessible of all Park glaciers is Grinnell. It can be reached by a
six-mile trip over an excellent trail from Many Glacier Hotel or Swiftcurrent
Camp. Sperry, likewise, can be reached by trail, although the
distance is several miles greater than in the case of Grinnell. The trip,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
however, can be broken and possibly made more interesting by an overnight
stop at Sperry Chalet, which is located about three miles from the
glacier. Siyeh is the only other regularly visited Park glacier. It lies
about half a mile beyond the end of the Cracker Lake trail, and can be
reached from that point by an easy walk through grassy meadows and a
short climb over a moraine. Siyeh, however, is less spectacular than
either Grinnell or Sperry, being much smaller and lacking crevasses, so
common on the other two. Few people make the spectacular trail trip
over Siyeh Pass but those who do may visit Sexton Glacier by making
a short detour of less than half a mile where the trail crosses the bench
on which the glacier lies. Sexton is a small glacier, but late in the summer
after its snow cover has melted off it exhibits many of the features
seen on much larger bodies of ice.</p>
<p>Interesting surface features which can be seen at times on any of
these glaciers include crevasses, moulins (glacier wells), debris cones,
and glacier tables. Crevasses are
cracks which occur in the ice of all
glaciers. They are especially numerous
on Sperry and Grinnell. Moulins,
or glacier wells, are deep vertical
holes which have been formed
by a stream of water which originally
plunged into a narrow crevasse.
Continual flow of the stream enlarges
that part of the crevasse, creating
a well. Several such features on
Sperry Glacier have penetrated to
depths of more than 200 feet, and
are 20 or more feet wide at the top.</p>
<p>No one can walk over the surface
of Grinnell Glacier without noticing
a number of conical mounds
of fine rock debris. Actually these
are cones of ice covered with a veneer,
seldom more than two inches
thick, of rock debris, so their name,
debris cone is somewhat misleading.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p03a.jpg" alt="" width="542" height="801" />
<p class="pcap"><b>CREVASSE IN SPERRY GLACIER</b></p>
</div>
<p>This rock material, usually deposited by a stream, protects the ice underneath
from the sun&rsquo;s rays. As the surface of the glacier, except that insulated
by the debris, is lowered by melting, the mounds form and grow
gradually higher until the debris slides from them, after which they are
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
speedily reduced to the level of the rest of the surface. They are seldom
higher than 3 or 4 feet.</p>
<p>A glacier table is a mound of ice capped, and therefore protected
from melting, by a large boulder. Its history is similar to that of the
debris cone. After a time the boulder slides off its perch, and then the
mound of ice melts away.</p>
<p>Snow which fills crevasses and wells during the winter often melts
out from below, leaving thin snowbridges in the early part of the summer.
These constitute real hazards to travel on a glacier because the thinner
ones are incapable of supporting a person&rsquo;s weight. This is one very
good reason why the inexperienced should never venture onto the surface
of a glacier without a guide.</p>
<p>It is probable that the Park glaciers are not remnants of the large
glaciers present during the Ice Age which terminated approximately
10,000 years ago, because it is known that several thousand years after
that time the climate of the Glacier National Park region was somewhat
drier and warmer than now. Under such conditions it is probable that
most, if not all, of the present glaciers could not have existed.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Shrinkage of Park Glaciers</span></h2>
<p>Prior to the beginning of the present century all glaciers in the
Park, and most of those in the rest of the world, began to shrink in
response to a slight change in climate, probably involving both a temperature
rise and a decrease in annual snowfall. From about 1900 to
1945 shrinkage of Park glaciers was very rapid. In other words these
glaciers were not in equilibrium with the climate, for less ice was added
to them each winter than disappeared by melting and evaporation during
the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>Over a period of several years such shrinkage is apparent to the eye
of an observer and is manifest by a lowering of the glacier&rsquo;s surface,
and more particularly by a &ldquo;retreat&rdquo; of the lower edge of the glacier.
This part of the ice is generally referred to as the ice front. When sufficient
snow is added to the upper part of the glacier to cause the ice at
the front to move forward equal to the rate at which it melts away,
the glacier is in equilibrium with the climate. When the yearly added
snow decreases in amount the ice front seems to retreat or move back,
whereas the mass of the glacier is merely decreasing by melting on top
and along the edges, just as a cube of ice left in the kitchen sink decreases
in size.</p>
<p>The National Park Service initiated observations on glacier variations
in 1931. At first the work consisted only of the determination of
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
the year by year changes in the ice front of each of the several glaciers.
From 1937 to 1939, inclusive, the program was expanded to include the
detailed mapping of Grinnell, Sperry, and Jackson Glaciers to serve as a
basis for comparisons in future years. Aerial photographs were obtained
of all the known Park glaciers in 1950 and 1952 and again in 1960.
Maps have been compiled and published of the Grinnell and Sperry Glaciers
based on the 1950 and 1960 aerial photography. The 1950 and 1960
maps of each glacier are shown on one sheet for convenience in comparison.</p>
<p>Since 1945, the glacier observations have been carried on in cooperation
with the U. S. Geological Survey. The work has included the periodic
measurement of profiles to determine changes occurring in the surface
elevation of Grinnell and Sperry Glaciers and also the determination of
the rate of annual movement. Some of the more important data yielded
by surveys on Grinnell and Sperry, the two largest glaciers in the Park,
are summarized in the following tabulations:</p>

<p>The Grinnell Glacier originally consisted of an upper and lower portion
connected by an ice tongue. This tongue disappeared in 1926 and
since then the two portions have been separate. The area of the upper
portion of the glacier was essentially the same in 1960 as in 1956&mdash;56
acres. The upper section is known as Salamander Glacier because of its
shape as viewed from a distance.</p>
<p>The terminal recession of the Grinnell Glacier is somewhat difficult
to determine accurately as a part of the terminal portion ends in
a lake, the shore of which varies from year to year. The recession for a
half-mile section extending southeast from the lake is shown below:</p>
<table class="center">

<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The values for area and recession shown above indicate that changes
in the area of the glacier have not been as pronounced since the mid-1940&rsquo;s
as they were prior to that time. Profile measurements starting in
1950 indicate a general trend of continued shrinkage although annual
changes have been both positive and negative. The 1965 observations
showed a surface lowering of 20 to 25 feet, since 1950.</p>
<p>The movement of the Grinnell Glacier, based on observations since
1947, has been about 35 to 40 feet per year.</p>
<p>The Sperry Glacier is located 9 miles from the Grinnell Glacier, on
the opposite side of the Continental Divide and at an altitude approximately
1,000 feet higher. It has also shown a continual shrinkage in
area and recession of the terminus as shown by the following tabulations:</p>

<p>Profile measurements, starting in 1949, indicate a continued lowering
of the glacier surface below an altitude of about 7,500 feet. Above this
altitude it has remained much the same during the period of observations
with annual changes, both positive and negative, with a possible
slight net increase since 1949.</p>
<p>The forward movement in the central portion of the Sperry Glacier,
based on observations since 1949, has averaged about 15 feet per year.
The rate of movement is presumed to be greater in the upper reaches of
the glacier.</p>
<p>It is of interest to note from the data that the changes in Sperry
Glacier are more pronounced than those in Grinnell Glacier although
the straight-line distance between them is only 9 miles. One possible
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
reason&mdash;Grinnell Glacier is on the eastern slope of the Continental
Divide whereas Sperry Glacier is on the western slope.</p>
<p>Even more significant is the lowering of the glacier&rsquo;s surface, from
which volume shrinkage may be obtained. In 1938 Sperry Glacier had a
thickness of 108 feet at the site of the 1946 ice margin. At this same place
in 1913 the thickness was nearly 500 feet, and the average thickness of
the glacier over the area from which it has since disappeared was at
least 300 feet.</p>
<p>The average thickness of <b>Grinnell Glacier</b> in 1937 at the site of the
1946 ice front was 73 feet. The surface of the entire glacier was lowered
56 feet during that nine-year period. This means that each year the
glacier was reduced in volume by an amount of ice equivalent to a cube
450 feet high.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="647" />
<p class="pcap"><b>GRINNELL GLACIER AS IT LOOKED PRIOR TO 1926 WHEN THE LOWER AND UPPER SEGMENTS WERE STILL
CONNECTED.</b></p>
</div>
<p>At the northern terminus of Grinnell Glacier, which is bordered by
a small marginal lake, a large section of the ice front fell into the water
on or about August 14, 1946, completely filling it with icebergs. This
event, although witnessed by no one, must have been comparable to
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
many of the icefalls which occur at the fronts of the large glaciers
along the southeast coast of Alaska.</p>
<p>The volume of Grinnell Glacier was reduced by about one-third
from September 1937 to September 1946. Several other glaciers have exhibited
a more phenomenal shrinkage than Sperry or Grinnell. The topographic
map of Glacier National Park, prepared in 1900-1902, shows
several comparatively large glaciers such as Agassiz, Blackfoot and Harrison.
Their shrinkage has been so pronounced that today Agassiz has
virtually disappeared and the other two are pitifully small remnants,
probably less than one-fifth the size they had been when originally mapped.</p>
<p>Since 1945, because of above-normal snowfall and subnormal temperatures,
glacier shrinkage has slowed down appreciably, coming virtually
to a standstill in 1950; and in 1951, for the first time since glacier
changes have been recorded in the Park, Grinnell Glacier increased
slightly in volume. This was also reflected by a readvance of the front.
Although no measurements were made in 1951 on other Park glaciers
some of them certainly made similar readvances. Thus the climatic
conditions which caused glaciers to shrink for fifty or more years seem
to have been replaced by conditions more favorable to the glaciers. Time
alone will tell whether the new conditions are temporary or mark the
beginning of a long cycle of wetter and cooler climate.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Former Extent of Park Glaciation</span></h2>
<p>During the Pleistocene Period or Ice Age when most of Canada and
a large portion of the United States were covered several times by an extensive
ice sheet or continental glacier, all the valleys of Glacier National
Park were filled with valley glaciers. These originated in the higher parts
of the Lewis and Livingstone Ranges. On the east side of the Lewis Range
they moved out onto the plains. From the Livingstone Range and the
west side of the Lewis Range they moved into the wide Flathead Valley.
During the maximum extent of these glaciers all of the area of the Park
except the summits of the highest peaks and ridges were covered with ice.</p>
<p>The great Two Medicine Glacier, with its source in the head of the
Two Medicine and tributary valleys, after reaching the plains spread out
into a big lobe (piedmont glacier) eventually attaining a distance of
about 40 miles from the eastern front of the mountains. The stream of
ice emerging onto the plains from St. Mary Valley also extended many
miles out from the mountain front. Several of these long valley glaciers
extended far enough out onto the plains to meet the edge of the vast
continental ice sheet moving westward from a center in the vicinity of
Hudson Bay. In the major Park valleys these glaciers attained thicknesses
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
of 3,000 or more feet. Although man probably never viewed this
magnificent spectacle, the Park at that time must have been similar in
aspect to some of the present day ice filled ranges along the Alaska-Yukon
border.</p>
<p>No one knows exactly how many times glaciers moved down the Park
valleys during the million or more years of the Pleistocene period, but
geologists have found evidence for at least eight distinct advances. It is
difficult to determine just when the first advance took place but it may
have been very early in the period. Most of the advances, however, occurred
during the past 70,000 years or so in what is known as the Wisconsin
stage of the Ice Age. Large glaciers flowed down the Park valleys probably
as late as 7,000 years ago. Between each of the major times of ice
advance, the glaciers, responding to warmer or drier climate, shrank to
small size and in some instances disappeared. These warmer intervals
varied in length from 2,000 to tens of thousands of years.</p>
<p>Evidence of the several distinct glacial advances is yielded by the
moraines, deposits of rock debris left by the ice. On the east side of
the Park the lower courses of the major valleys and the adjoining ridges
in the Park and on the adjacent plains are covered with moraines. The
material in them ranges in size from clay to large boulders, and was deposited
by glaciers after being transported down the valleys. The debris
deposited by the latest ice advance is fresh in appearance and contains
fragments of all Park rocks. Moraines of the earlier stages, because of
much greater age, are more weathered. They contain many fragments of
much weathered diorite, from the layer of rock that appears as a conspicuous
black band on many of the mountains, and almost no fragments
of limestone, so common in the newest moraines. The diorite is more resistant
to weathering than the limestone which slowly dissolves in ground-water.
The only localities where the oldest moraine occurs are the crests
of the ridges which run eastward from the mountains out onto the plains.
This material is especially abundant on St. Mary Ridge. On top of Two
Medicine Ridge along and just above the highway, fragments of this material
have been cemented together into a comparatively hard tillite.
Lower down on the slopes the older moraine cannot be found as it is
covered by that of the later glacial advances which were less extensive
and did not override the ridge crests as did the earlier glaciers. The older
debris is also found on top of Milk River and Boulder Ridges.</p>
<p>Following the last maximum advance of the Wisconsin glaciers they
slowly shrank until about 6,000 years ago when all glacial ice probably
disappeared from the mountains. After this there was a warm, dry period
during which it is probable that no glaciers were present. Then about
4,000 years ago the present small glaciers were born. During the period
of their existence they have fluctuated in size, probably attaining maximum
dimensions around the middle of the last century. Since then they
have been getting smaller.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Park Features Resulting From Glaciation</span></h2>
<p>A glacier is an extremely powerful agent of erosion, capable of profoundly
altering the landscape over which it passes.</p>
<p>Glaciers erode mainly by two processes, <b>plucking</b> and <b>abrasion</b>. The
first is more active near the head of the glacier, but may take place anywhere
throughout its course; abrasion or scouring is effective underneath
most sections of the glacier, particularly where the ice moves in a well-defined
channel.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">

<p class="pcap"><b>MT. OBERLIN CIRQUE AND BIRD WOMAN FALLS</b> (HILEMAN PHOTO)</p>
</div>
<p>In plucking, the glacier actually quarries out masses of rock, incorporates
them within itself, and carries them along. At the head of the
glacier this is accomplished mainly by water which trickles into crevices
and freezes around blocks of rock, causing them to be pulled out by the
glacier, and also by the weight of the glacier, squeezing ice into the cracks
in the rock. As the glacier moves forward these blocks of ice are dragged
or carried along with it. Usually a large crevasse, the <b>bergschrund</b>,
develops in the ice at the head of a glacier. The bergschrund of most
glaciers in the park consists of an opening, usually 10 to 20 feet wide at
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
the top and as much as 50 feet deep, between the head of the glacier and
the mountain wall. On Sperry Glacier, however, it is more typical of
that found on larger valley glaciers and consists of several conspicuous
crevasses separating the firn area (where the snow is compacted into
ice) on top of Gunsight Mountain from the glacier proper below (see
<a href="#cover">photo on the cover</a>). It is at this site that plucking is most dominant because
water enters by day and freezes in the rock crevices at night. This
quarrying headward and downward finally results in the formation of a
steep-sided basin called a <b>cirque</b> or <b>glacial amphitheatre</b>. Because the
cirque is the first place that ice forms and the place from which it disappears
last, it is subjected to glacial erosion longer than any other part
of the valley. Thus its floor is frequently plucked and scraped out to a
comparatively great depth so that a body of water known as a <b>cirque lake</b>
forms after the glacier disappears. Iceberg Lake lies in one of the most
magnificent cirques in the Park. The lowest point on the crest of the
wall encircling three sides of the lake is more than 1500 feet above the
water. Prior to 1940 this cirque contained a small glacier. It has been
shrinking rapidly for about two decades, and in the last two or three years
of its existence was hardly recognizable as a glacier. Its disappearance is
made more remarkable by the knowledge that in 1920 the front of the
glacier rose in a sheer wall of ice nearly 100 feet above the surface of the
lake. All that remains of this glacier which once kept the lake filled with
icebergs each summer is a large bank of snow at the base of the cirque wall
at the head of the lake. Other good examples of cirques are those which
hold Hidden, Avalanche and Cracker Lakes. The tremendous cliff on the
south side of the latter rises 4,100 feet from the lake to the summit of
Mount Siyeh. Other notable cirque lakes are Ellen Wilson, Gunsight,
Ptarmigan and Upper Two Medicine.</p>

<p>Rock fragments of various sizes frozen into the bottom and sides
of the ice form a huge file or rasp which abrades or wears away the
bottom and sides of the valley down which the glacier flows. The valley
thus attains a characteristic U-shaped cross section, with steep sides
(not necessarily vertical) and a broad bottom. A mountain valley cut
entirely by a stream does not have such shape because the stream cuts
only in the bottom of the valley, whereas a glacier, filling its valley to
a great depth, abrades along the sides as well as on the floor. Practically
all valleys of the Park, especially the major ones, possess the U-shaped
cross section. This feature can best be seen by looking down from the
head of the valley rather than from the valley floor. Splendid examples
are the Swiftcurrent Valley viewed from Swiftcurrent Pass or Lookout;
St. Mary Valley from east of Logan Pass; the Belly River Valley from
Ptarmigan Tunnel; and Cataract Creek Valley from Grinnell Glacier.</p>

<p>The floors of many of the Park&rsquo;s major <b>U-shaped valleys</b> instead of
having a more or less uniform slope, steeper near the head than farther
down, as is usually the case in a normal stream valley, are marked by
several steep drops or &ldquo;steps,&rdquo; between which the valley floor has a
comparatively gentle slope. Such a valley floor, throughout its entire
course, is sometimes termed the <b>glacial stairway</b>. Most of the steps,
particularly those in the lower courses of the valleys, are due to differences
in resistance of the rocks over which the former ice flowed. On
the east side of the Lewis Range, where the steps are especially pronounced,
the rock strata of which the mountains are composed dip toward
the southwest, directly opposite to the direction of the slope of the
valley floors (<a href="#fig10">Figure 1</a>). Thus, as glaciers flowed from the center of
the range down toward the plains, they cut across the edges of these
tilted rock layers; where the ice flowed over weaker beds it was able
to scour out the valley floor more deeply creating a &ldquo;tread&rdquo; of the
glacial stairway. The more resistant rock formations were less easily
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
removed, and the ice stream, in moving away from the edges of these
resistant strata, employed its powers of plucking and quarrying to give
rise to cliffs or &ldquo;risers.&rdquo; Lakes dammed partly by the resistant rock
strata now fill depressions scoured out of the weaker rock on the treads
(<a href="#fig10">Figure 1</a>). These are <b>rock-basin lakes</b>, and where several of them are
strung out along the course of the valley they are referred to as <b>paternoster
lakes</b> because their arrangement resembles that of beads on a
string. Well-known examples of such bodies of water are Swiftcurrent
and Bullhead Lakes, two of the long series which stretches for seven
miles between Many Glacier Hotel and Swiftcurrent Pass. Resistant
layers in the lower portion of the Altyn formation, the upper part of
the Appekunny, and the upper part
of the Grinnell<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
normally create risers.</p>

LAKES. GLENN AND CROSSLEY LAKES IN DISTANCE; UNNAMED
LAKE IN FOREGROUND RESTS IN A HANGING
VALLEY AND ITS OUTLET DROPS SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET
TO THE MAIN VALLEY</b> (HILEMAN PHOTO)</p>
</div>
<p>The tributaries of glacial valleys
are also peculiar in that they usually
enter the main valley high
above its floor and for this reason
are known as <b>hanging valleys</b>. The
thicker a stream of ice, the more
erosion it is capable of performing;
consequently, the main valley
becomes greatly deepened, whereas
the smaller glacier in the tributary
valley does not cut down so rapidly,
leaving its valley hanging high
above the floor of the major valley.
The valleys of Virginia and Florence
Creeks, tributary to the St.
Mary Valley are excellent examples
of hanging valleys. A splendid view
of Virginia Creek valley may be
had from Going-to-the-Sun Road
near the head of St. Mary Lake.
The valley above Bird Woman Falls
as seen from Going-to-the-Sun Road
just west of Logan Pass is a
spectacular illustration of a hanging valley. In addition there are many
others, such as Preston Park, on the trail from St. Mary to Piegan Pass;
and the Hanging Gardens near Logan Pass.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>REYNOLDS MOUNTAIN AT LOGAN PASS&mdash;A TYPICAL HORN</b></p>
</div>
<p>Even more conspicuous than the large U-shaped valleys and their
hanging tributaries are the long, sharp-crested, jagged ridges which form
most of the backbone of the Lewis Range. These features of which the
Garden Wall is one of the most noticeable, are known as <b>aretes</b> and owe
their origin to glaciers. As the former long valley glaciers enlarged their
cirques by cutting farther in toward the center of the range, the latter
finally was reduced to a very narrow steep-sided ridge, the arete. The
imposing height of the Garden Wall can readily be determined by using
the layer of diorite as a scale. The conspicuous black band formed by
the edge of this layer has an average width of 75 feet. So, from the
porch of the Many Glacier Hotel a Park visitor can readily see that the
Garden Wall, even though five miles distant, is about 4,200 feet high.
The height of other aretes can be just as readily obtained, for the band
of diorite appears on the faces of most of them. In certain places glaciers
on opposite sides of the arete nearly cut through creating a low
place known as a <b>col</b>, usually called a <b>pass</b>. Gunsight, Logan, Red Eagle,
Stoney Indian and Piegan are only a few of the many such passes in the
Park. At places three or more glaciers plucked their way back toward a
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
common point leaving at their heads a conspicuous, sharp-pointed peak
known as a <b>horn</b>. Innumerable such horn peaks occur throughout both
the Lewis and Livingstone Ranges. Excellent examples near Logan Pass
are Reynolds, Bearhat, and Clements Mountains. Other imposing horns
are Split Mountain at the head of Red Eagle Valley, Kinnerly Peak in
the Kintla Valley, and Mount Wilbur in Swiftcurrent Valley. The horn
peak, because of its precipitous sides, is especially attractive to mountain
climbers. The comparatively recent dates of first ascents on many Park
peaks attest to the difficulties they offer the mountaineer. Mount Wilbur,
despite proximity to Many Glacier Hotel and camp, was unclimbed until
1923; Mount St. Nicholas succumbed in 1926, and the first ascent of
Kinnerly Peak was made by several members of the Sierra Club in 1937.</p>
<p>Another feature of the Park which
must be attributed partly to glaciation
is the waterfall. There are two
principal types, one which occurs in
the bottom of the main valleys and
one at the mouth of the hanging
tributary valleys. The former, exemplified
by Swiftcurrent, Red
Rock, Dawn Mist, Trick, Morning
Eagle and others, is located where
streams drop over the risers of the
glacial stairway. In other words, resistant
layers of rock which the
former glaciers were unable to entirely
wear away give rise to this
type of fall.</p>
<p>Examples of the hanging tributary
type of fall which is due directly
to the activity of the glaciers
are Florence, Bird Woman, Virginia,
Grinnell, Lincoln, and many
others.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/p08a.jpg" alt="" width="528" height="800" />
<p class="pcap"><b>TRICK FALLS IN THE TWO MEDICINE RIVER</b></p>
</div>
<p>No less conspicuous than the mountains themselves are the lakes. In
most instances glaciers have been either directly or indirectly responsible
for the origin of the several hundred in the Park. In general, these lakes
may be divided into five main types, depending upon their origin.</p>
<p><b>(1) Cirque lakes.</b> This type of lake frequently is circular in outline
and fills the depression plucked out of solid rock by a glacier at its
source. Some of the most typical examples are listed in the foregoing
discussion of cirques.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p><b>(2) Other rock-basin lakes.</b> This type, referred to above, fills basins
created where glaciers moved over areas of comparatively weak rock.
In all cases the lake is held in by a bedrock dam. A typical example is
Swiftcurrent, which lies behind a dam of massive Altyn Limestone layers.
The highway, just before it reaches Many Glacier Hotel, crosses this
riser of the glacier stairway.</p>
<p><b>(3) Lakes held in by outwash.</b> Most of the large lakes on the west
side of the Park fall in this category. The dams holding in these lakes
are composed of stratified gravel which was washed out from former
glaciers when they extended down into the lower parts of the valleys.
Lake McDonald, largest in the Park, is of this type.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="618" />
<p class="pcap"><b>ST. MARY LAKE FROM GOOSE ISLAND OVERLOOK</b></p>
</div>
<p><b>(4) Lakes held by alluvial fans.</b> St. Mary, Waterton, Lower St.
Mary, and Lower Two Medicine Lakes belong in this group. These bodies
of water may have been rock-basin lakes, but at a recent date on their history
streams entering the lake valley have completely blocked the valley
with deposits of gravel; thus either creating a lake or raising the level of
one already present. St. Mary and Lower St. Mary Lakes probably were
joined originally to make a lake 17 miles long. More recently Divide
Creek, entering this long lake from the south, built an alluvial fan of
gravel where it entered the lake. This fan was large enough to cut the
lake into the two present bodies of water. The St. Mary Entrance Station
at the eastern end of Going-to-the-Sun Road, is located on this alluvial
fan, the form of which can readily be distinguished from a point
along the road at the north side of the upper lake near its outlet.</p>
<p><b>(5) Moraine lakes.</b> Most lakes with moraines at their outlets are
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
partly dammed by outwash or rock ridges. One of the prominent examples
is Josephine Lake near Many Glacier Hotel. The moraine which is
partly responsible for the lake is a hill which can be seen from Many
Glacier Hotel. Several of the large lakes on the west side of the Park
are also held partly or entirely by moraines.</p>
<p>Another type of moraine lake, which occurs only at Sperry and Grinnell
Glaciers, has already been mentioned. It differs from all other Park
lakes in having a glacier for part of its shoreline. There are two of these
lakes at Sperry and one at Grinnell. Despite their small size, they are
tremendously interesting, not only because of their relation to the glacier,
but also because they are ordinarily filled with icebergs throughout the
summer. Their surfaces often remain frozen until mid-summer.</p>
<p>There are several types of minor importance, the principal one of
which is that formed by a landslide damming the valley.</p>
<p>One cannot remain long in Glacier National Park without noticing
the varying colors of its lake waters. In fact this feature is so striking
that ranger-naturalists probably are questioned more about it than about
any other feature or phenomenon. To find the answer we must go again,
as in so many instances, to the glaciers. As the ice moves it continually
breaks rock fragments loose. Some of these are ground into powder
as they move against each other and against the bedrock under the
glacier. Most types of rock, especially the limestones and shales on which
the Park glaciers rest, when ground fine enough yield a gray powder.
All melt-water streams issuing from glaciers are cloudy or milky from
their load of this finely ground &ldquo;rock flour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Water from Grinnell Glacier is so laden with rock flour that the
small lake along the edge of the ice into which the water pours is nearly
white. Much of the silt is deposited in this lake, but enough is carried
downstream to give Grinnell Lake a beautiful turquoise hue. Some of
the very finest sediment which fails to settle in Grinnell Lake is carried
a mile farther to Josephine Lake to give it a blue-green color. Even
Swiftcurrent Lake, still farther downstream, does not contain clear water.</p>
<p>The rock flour which colors these as well as other Park lakes can
also be seen in the streams. Baring Creek at Sunrift Gorge (see p. 13 in
Motorist&rsquo;s Guide) is milky with powdered rock from Sexton Glacier.
Cataract Creek along the trail between Josephine and Grinnell Lakes
is noticeably milky, extraordinarily so in mid-afternoon on very warm
days. At such times melting of the glaciers is accelerated and more silt
is then supplied to the streams.</p>
<p>Part of Sperry Glacier, in contrast to Grinnell, rests on a bright red
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
shaly rock (known to the geologists as argillite) which yields a red-gray
powder when finely ground. Hence the water in several small lakes adjacent
to the glacier has a pinkish tint.</p>
<p>Although a large number of Park streams are fed by glaciers there
are many others, particularly in the south and west sections, which have
no ice as their source. On a trail trip from Sunrift Gorge to Virginia
Falls, one is certain to be impressed by the extreme clarity of the water
in Virginia Creek. For half a mile below the falls the trail follows this
cascading torrent from one crystal pool to another. So clear is the water
that we are apt to mistake for wading pools places where the water may
be five or more feet deep. Snyder Creek near Lake McDonald Lodge
nearly rivals Virginia Creek in clarity. The sources of these two streams
obviously are not melting glaciers.</p>
<p>From the foregoing discussion, it is evident that glaciers constitute
one of the principal controlling factors in the color of the water in Park
streams and lakes. Where there are no ice masses streams are clear, and
where glaciers occur the water possesses many shades varying from clear
blue through turquoise to gray, and
in rare cases even pink.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>MORAINE NEAR GRINNELL GLACIER IS 120 FEET HIGH.
THE GLACIER EXTENDED NEARLY TO TOP OF MORAINE
50 YEARS AGO.</b> (DYSON PHOTO)</p>
</div>
<p>Although the former large glaciers
of the Ice Age transported
huge amounts of rock debris down
the valleys of the Park, the <b>moraines</b>
which they deposited are, as
a rule, not conspicuous features of
the landscape. The Going-to-the-Sun
Road, however, crosses several
accumulations of moraine in which
road cuts have been made. The road
traverses a number of such places
along the shore of Lake McDonald.
Because of the large proportions of
rock flour (clay) in these accumulations,
the material continually slumps, sometimes sliding onto the road
surface. One of these cuts has been partly stabilized by a lattice-like
framework of logs. The largest excavation in moraine along the highway
is located about three miles east of Logan Pass just below the big loop
where the road crosses Siyeh Creek. The surfaces of many boulders in
this moraine are marked by grooves and scratches, imparted to them as
they were scraped along the side of the valley by the glacier 10,000 or
more years ago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>A small moraine is exposed along the exit road from the parking
lot at Many Glacier Hotel. It contains a number of small red boulders,
the sources of which are the red rock ledges in the mountains several
miles up the Swiftcurrent Valley, plainly visible from the hotel.</p>
<p>One of these ancient moraines which has been eroded into a series
of mounds (25 to 100 feet high)
extends from Swiftcurrent Cabin
Camp down the valley on the north
side of the road to a point near
the entrance to Many Glacier Ranger
Station. Some of the cabins are
actually situated in a space between
two of the highest mounds.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">

<p class="pcap"><b>LOOKING SOUTH ALONG THE GRINNELL GLACIER ICE
FRONT. NOTE CREVASSES ALONG WHICH BERGS
ARE BREAKING OFF.</b> (DYSON PHOTO)</p>
</div>
<p>Surrounding all existing Park
glaciers are two sets of <b>recent moraines</b>
varying in height from a few
feet to more than two hundred. So
recently (probably 800 to 900 years)
have the glaciers withdrawn from
the older of these that only sparse
willows and other forms of dwarf
vegetation are growing on them.</p>
<p>The younger set of moraines, which has accumulated during the last
several hundred years, consists of unweathered rock on which only small
pioneer plants and lichens have begun to establish themselves. These moraines
are particularly striking at Grinnell, Sperry, Blackfoot, Agassiz
and Sexton Glaciers.
On the last few yards of the spectacular Grinnell
Glacier trail all persons who make the trip to the glacier must climb
over the moraine before setting foot on the ice. From this vantage point
on the highest part of this moraine the visitor can look down upon a
huge crevassed mass of ice lying in a stupendous rock-walled amphitheater,
then merely by facing the opposite direction, he will see unfolded
before his view one of the most colorful vistas in the Park. More than a
thousand feet below in the head of a splendid U-shaped valley lies the turquoise
gem of Grinnell Lake. A mile farther away the blue surface of
Lake Josephine stands out in sharp contrast to the dark green of the
spruce which lines its shores. High above he can see the red summit of
Mount Allen carrying its white snowbanks into the deep blue of a
Montana sky.
Despite this magnificence the visitor must soon turn his
attention to the tremendous accumulation upon which he stands, for it is
no less interesting than the mountains and lakes. Among the many
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
boulders which lie along the path are two
prominent limestone blocks each 10 to 15 feet in diameter. The
underside of one was grooved and polished as the ice pushed it
across the rock surface underlying the glacier. The other, partially
embedded in the moraine, has a polished upper surface because the
glacier flowed over it for a time. Both these boulders, although
now nearly 300 yards from the ice front, were covered by the
glacier until about 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Because of shrinkage many of the glaciers are no longer in contact
with these newer moraines. In some cases a quarter of a mile of
bare rock surface intervenes between the moraine and the glacier which made it.</p>
<p>A few glaciers have disappeared within recent years, but their moraines
remain as evidence of former glacier activity. One of the most notable
examples is afforded by Clements Glacier, a small body of ice which existed
until about 1938 in the shadow of Clements Mountain at Logan Pass. Its
edge was bordered by a ridge-like moraine nearly a hundred feet high.
Today, the trail from Logan Pass to Hidden Lake skirts the outside edge
of the moraine. Should the hiker leave the trail and climb the few yards
to the top of this moraine he could see it stretched out before him as
a giant necklace encircling the base of Clements Mountain, but between
mountain and moraine, where a few years ago the glacier lay, he will
see only bare rock or drifted snow.</p>
<p>Despite recent rapid shrinkage of glaciers and the disappearance of some,
Glacier National Park still is a land of ice, yet when the visitor views
its present day glaciers and its sublimely beautiful mountain scenery
he should not be unmindful of the powerful forces which, working during
many thousands of years, have brought it all about. Then, and only then,
can he properly appreciate the magnificence which Nature has so generously
bestowed upon us.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
